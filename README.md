A hotel booking system based on Spring boot

## Architecture

![Architecture](document/architecture.png 'Architecture')

We created our own APIs and used APIs from some third party.

## Front-end

![Front-end](document/frontend.png 'Front-end')

We used boot-strap for the front-end development.

## APIs

We have created "Customer API" and "Itinerary API". We used a weather API from Open Weather to show in the main page. And a google API to show the location of the hotel.

## Database

We used MySql to manage the data.
